<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles matrices.

An instance can be constructed from an array with an obligatory field 'preset',
which should be one of the following:
const IDENTITY = "IDENTITY";
const SCALE = "SCALE";
const RX = "Ox ROTATION";
const RY = "Oy ROTATION";
const RZ = "Oz ROTATION";
const TRANSLATION = "TRANSLATION";
const PROJECTION = "PROJECTION";

With 'preset' set as SCALE parameter 'scale' should also be passed
(scale ratio).
With 'preset' set as RX, RY, or RZ, parameter 'angle' should also be passed
(angle in radians).
With 'preset' set as TRANSLATION parameter 'vtc' should also be passed.
(a translation vector should be an instance of Vector class).
With 'preset' set as PROJECTION parameters 'fov', 'ratio', 'near' and 'far'
should also be passed (field of view angle in degrees, image ratio,
near and far clipping planss).

The class provides the following methods :

Matrix mult( Matrix $rhs ) : returns the multiplication of both matrices.

Vertex transformVertex( Vertex $vtx ) : returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
